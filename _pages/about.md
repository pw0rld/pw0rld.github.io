## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi,everyone! I'm Wei Peng, and I graduated from **Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications (XUPT)** in July 2021 with a Bachelor of Engineering in **Cybersecurity**. Welcome to my personal pages.

Now I'm a Research Assistant (RA) at [Teecertlab](https://teecertlabs.com/).


I am very enthusiastic about research on Software Analysis and Attack Detection. Being a cool researcher and hacker of cyber security is something I'm interested in.
